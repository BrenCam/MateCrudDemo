About this demo
</H3>

<P>
	This is a demo of a CRUD (Create/Update/Delete) database application that I put together using Flex and the Mate framework. I created this demo project to explore the process of converting a (non trivial) client/server app to an equivalent RIA/Web version. 
</P>
	In my Flex reasearch I found quite a few Flex demos available online. While many of these demonstrate a specific Flex feature(s), they do not address the needs of a real world application front end (e.g. multi form navigation, logon, logoff, interaction between forms, popup forms etc). This demo includes functionality to address some of those real world requirements. 
	
<P/>
	<b>Note:</b> This is a stand alone demo (you can run it without installing any SQL database) - data is managed in memory - using array collections that are initialized at startup. While you can add and delete data note that all the changes will be lost when you leave. (A future version may use a real database - but for learning purposes I have kept things simple).<br/>
